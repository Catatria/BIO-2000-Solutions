For the last test, the answer it gives you is different to the answers on the markscheme; however, it is still correct.
Proof: "www.shorturl.at/CFT14" or "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_kKzVkg_O4bm8mu5jpZ7_C3qjI-kHdi7pLFs1WH2P6w"

Question 1's solution is very efficient; however, Question 2's solution is less efficient and Question 3's solution is a tangled mess of spaghetti.
The language I'm using is Python.
Questions 1 and 2 have comments explaining how they work, but Question 3 doesn't.

Any issue or questions with the code can be put into the issues tab. I will try to answer them to the best of my ability.

Question 3 progress: ~50%

Question 1's solution is very efficient; however, Question 2's solution is less efficient and Question 3's solution is a tangled mess of spaghetti.
The language I'm using is Python.
Questions 1 and 2 have comments explaining how they work, but Question 3 doesn't.

Any issue or questions with the code can be put into the issues tab. I will try to answer them to the best of my ability.

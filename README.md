# BIO-Solutions

### Feel free to copy the code, just make sure to credit me (@Pararcana).

All of the code score full marks, and no libraries are used.

BIO 2000 Q3 is a mess (partial marks due to time constraints), and I am currently working on a revamp.

Any issues or questions with the code, such as if you want me to explain any methods I used or how the code works, can be put into the issues tab. I will try to answer them to the best of my ability. I am not looking for solutions by anyone else, as I intend for this repository to only include my solutions. Please do not be offended if I reject a pull request.

You can find which solutions I have in the table below:

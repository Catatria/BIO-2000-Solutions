All of the code score full marks, and no libraries are used.

BIO 2000 Q3 is a mess, and will be revamped soon.

All of the Question 1 solutions have been solved in 25 lines or under.

Any issues or questions with the code can be put into the issues tab. I will try to answer them to the best of my ability.

I am not looking for solutions by anyone else, as I intend for this repository to only include my solutions. Please do not be offended if I reject a pull request.

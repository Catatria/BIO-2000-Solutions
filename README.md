# BIO-2000-Solutions
Feel free to copy the code, just make sure to credit me (@Catatria).

Question 1's solution is very efficient; however, Question 2's solution is less efficient and Question 3's solution is a tangled mess of spaghetti.

Questions 1 and 2 have comments explaining how they work, but Question 3 doesn't.

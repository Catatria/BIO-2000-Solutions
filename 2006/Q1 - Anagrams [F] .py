print(sorted(input("Word 1: ")) == sorted(input("Word 2: ")) and "Anagrams" or "Not anagrams")
"""
Difficulty: F
This one was so easy, I could solve it in one line. Once you realise that sorting is the
most efficient way to solve it, the solution comes easily. The other way of solving it; by
counting of the number of times each letter occurs in each word isn't very hard either.
